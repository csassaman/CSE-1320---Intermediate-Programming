# Bitwise Operations

- Virtually any programming language will provide some way of operating on individual bits
- Depending on your application, bitwise operators can be essential for reaching peak performance of keeping your data footpring small
- C provides the following bitwise operators. All but the NOT operator are binary

|__Symbol__|__Description__|
|----------|-------------|
|`&`|bitwise AND|
|`\|`|bitwise OR|
|`^`|bitwise XOR|
|`<<`|left shift|
|`>>`|right shift|
|`~`|bitwise NOT|

## Bitwise Shift

## Bitwise NOT

- Applying the `~` to a value negates the bits
- That is, the 1's are flipped to 0 and vice versa

### Twos Complement

- Two's complement is a mathematical operation used for signed number representation
- __Definition__: The two's complement of an _n_-bit number is defined as its complement with respect to 2^_n_. The cum of a number and it's two's complement is 2^_n_
